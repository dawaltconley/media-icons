# This file contains contact and social media information. Most values should be urls, with some exceptions. `email` takes an email address and `phone` takes a phone number (with country code). `twitter` can take a twitter handle.
# This information may be displayed throughout the site, but the main place you will find it is in the footer. Adding new information will create a new corresponding icon. You can also reorder the key-value pairings to change the order in which the icons display.
# Currently, only the media shown here is supported. Contact me if you need support for different sites or kinds of media.
